# Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning project of the Data Analyst jobs in the US.

The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/data-analyst-jobs

The purpose of this project is to find the factors that correlate with the salary of data analyst jobs. After the data exploration, I intend to make a machine learning model to predict the salary of a data analyst job based on this dataset.
